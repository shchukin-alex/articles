1. Basics
    Atomics
    Peterson algorithm
2. Compare and swap (CAS) and other primitives
    The implementation
    FAA
    Spin lock implementation
3. Memory model

    Sequential consistency
    Relaxed consistency
    Why memory synchronization is bad?
    Memory barrier is faster than lock (comparable to cost of L2 cache access)
